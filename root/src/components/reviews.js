          Undead Unluck begins with an attempted suicide. I am not going to make
          assumptions about how Japanese audiences reacted to this scene. And
          I'm certainly not going to wash my dirty laundry in public. Not here,
          on this first review. Not yet. But I will confess, this scene did
          remind me of how tempting a solution the immediate cessation of my
          bodily processes sounded to teenage me. The somewhat frivolous
          handling of the normally impactful subject matter can be forgiven, or
          at least overlooked, because of its fantastical context. And is this
          not always the case? It's a rather common scenario to see characters
          in fiction contemplate death as an escape from their more supernatural
          conundrums. The child of a dark lord, the unwilling chosen one, the
          walking time bomb. Our protagonist, Fuuko, is an example of this last
          category. Ever since she was a child, everyone she touched was cursed
          with dangerous, even fatal misfortune. So, having read the newly
          released final chapter of her favorite manga, she sees no more reason
          to prolong her unfortunate existence. Boy, isn't that one relatable?
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Fate plays its hand essentially immediately with this one. Fuuko's
          attempt is interrupted by our second protagonist. That's right. We've
          got 2 central characters at the forefront of this tale. And it makes
          sense to reveal now that you're looking at a romance series. Yes, it's
          a paranormal mystery battle manga, but it's also a love story. Not in
          the sense that other battle manga have tangential love stories, like
          the admittedly shallow domesticity of Goku and Chichi, or the
          committed but quiet engagement of Yoh and Anna Asakura, or the
          footnote that is the marriage between Naruto and Hinata. These two's
          relationship is front and center, beginning with this intriguing first
          encounter.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Just as Fuuko is warning those who might attempt to save her by
          claiming that touching her means death, she is restrained by a hunk of
          a man. This guy is clearly more of a Kenshiro or maybe a Goku than a
          Luffy or a Deku. He is big, imposing, and in a lot of panels even
          monstrous. We'll get back to that in a minute. For now let's go back
          to first impressions. This man beats her to the punch. He walks into a
          knife she’s holding, stabbing himself without much of a reaction. He’s
          roughly handling Fuuko, clearly interested in the veracity of her
          threats. From the instant he lands on the page, he’s loud, confident,
          impulsive, and carefree. We’ll learn eventually that this is almost
          all opposite of Fuuko. For now, we know they have something in common.
          This man wants to die too. By the second page of the story, Fuuko has
          met her perfect complement.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          After this brief introduction we see Fuuko’s powers in action. Once he
          lets go of her, the man is summarily torn to pieces by the very train
          Fuuko had been waiting to jump infront of. She’s immediately
          concerned, reinforcing the already clear guilt and responsibility she
          feels for her condition. “Zombie!” She exclaims as her
          self-flagellation is interrupted by the severed head of her recent
          victim. “Undead!” he corrects her. Earlier we heard Fuuko name her
          curse Unluck. In this early echoing of the series title we’re
          introduced to the nomenclature of the story’s power system. And just
          as she is able to negate others’ luck, we’re shown in amusing
          spectacle how Undead is able to negate his own death. Cheeky scenes of
          cartoonish mutilation serve as one of the principal flavors of the
          series. From this early on we see Tozuka play with Undead’s anatomy
          with dynamic panels depicting the non-zombie in varying stages of
          regeneration. There is joy in his movements, a distinct kinetic energy
          that clearly communicates the violence and speed with which his body
          replaces missing parts and mends injuries. We see him regrow his
          entire body from the stump of his decapitated noggin. Undead is
          reckless in life and battle because there is no such thing as danger
          to him.

          As he’s probing Fuuko from information on her Unluck, Undead continues
          to be brash and impudent, bordering on unpleasant. After a bout of
          fondling and threatening the consequences of his next stroke of Unluck
          send Fuuko flying from the roof of a high-rise. In her descent she
          begins to regret her deathwish after all. She has a pure heart and
          simple desires. Her remorse is missing out on fashion and romance,
          missing out on normalcy. A dashing scene of heroism is colored
          irreverent by Undead’s nakedness and the ludicrously massive censor
          bar between his legs. This contrasts amusingly with the dreamy framing
          of Undead’s tender embrace of Fuuko, with his reassurance that he
          won’t let her come to harm. After all, he’s finally found her. This
          romantic phrasing is interrupted by a declaration of self-interest.
          He’s been looking for someone who could possibly make him die.{" "}

          This scene draws the attention of a mysterious group of antagonists.
          The potential conflict takes a backseat to the progression of Fuuko
          and her pushy companion’s relationship. Clearly aware that she’s
          unfamiliar with the exact boundaries of her Unluck, Fuuko and Undead
          begin to learn about each other as he tests and questions her.
          Tragically, Fuuko recalls that the worst strokes Unluck comes for the
          people she cares for the most. Her parents died after hugging her, but
          when her grandfather and Undead did the same their misfortune was
          negligible. The pain of having lost her family is however an old
          wound, Fuuko’s suffering is mostly exacerbated by her innability to
          connect with anyone else, out of a fear of hurting them. When her hat
          comes off she’s embarrassed by the state of her hair, long, damaged
          and unkempt. Her condition means she’s been unable to receive any kind
          of assistance for the past 10 years. In her short life Fuuko has
          missed out on everything. In his impossibly long life, Undead has
          missed out on nothing. He reveals that at some point he’s even dabbled
          in hair styling. We’re treated to a compassionate scene in which he
          carefully and meticulously cuts and shapes down Fuuko’s hair to a
          healthy condition. We’ve learned now that just as he can be brazen, he
          can be gentle and comforting. He’s still forward and assertive, but he
          makes a tactful effort to bring her solace in the mundane yet
          painfully yearned for act of a haircut.

          Their bonding is interrupted by the delivery of the earlier setup. The
          mysterious group tracking them makes itself known by beheading Undead
          once more. They are clearly prepared to confront him, holding
          equipment specifically designed to restrain him. They intoduce to us
          more key concepts. Undead and Unluck are specifically types of
          Negators, and this group views them as threats. They lump them
          together with Unidentified Mysterious Animals, hinting that there is
          more magic to this world than what we’ve seen so far. Fuuko tries to
          make a case for Undead, now at least somewhat endeared to him. Their
          assailants are unconcerned with her protests and a battle begins that
          serves to lay down more hooks to catch our interest. Where do these
          guys get their equipment? They have an unbreakable sword, probably the
          work of another negator. How far can Undead push his power? He reveals
          he has a limiter he can remove to access and eternal lifetime’s worth
          of memories. The awakened Undead easily exploits the dynamics of his
          regeneration to swiftly neutralize (read: kill) numerous goons. Can
          Fuuko learn to use her Unluck effectively in battle? The climax of the
          combat scene implies yes, as Fuuko kisses Undead, confident he will
          survive but that the impact of the misfortune will be enough to
          dispose of their enemies.

          This explosive first chapter closes with a budding friendship between
          the two. Fuuko is glad to finally have someone in her life she can
          “safely” touch. She even gives him a nickname, Andy, derived
          phonetically from Undead as he doesn’t remember his actual name.
          Excited by the idea that a kiss lead to so much damage he chases Fuuko
          trying to convince her they should shag and see what happens. The
          narration gives us a compelling promise, this will be the story of the
          greatest death ever.
