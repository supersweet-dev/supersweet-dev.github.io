          Desired death. Fated death. Prolonged death. Accidental death.
          Vengeful death. Regretful death. Sacrificial death. Senseless death.
          This manga deals with death in all its forms. It is central, constant
          and ever present, as threat and reward. This is a story of people who
          want to kill, people who want to die, and people who want to live. In
          the pages of Undead Unluck, Yoshifumi Tozuka dares to try and tell the
          story of the greatest death ever.

        <p>
          I somewhat foolishly began this review simply because I had a copy of
          volume 1 on hand. I had been following the series since chapter 1 and
          I had mostly enjoyed it. I remembered thinking some arcs were not very
          engaging but the series normally ranked among my current favorites in
          Shonen Jump. Reading a series weekly is a completely different
          experience than reading it as a whole. I had realized this before. I
          often found myself appreciating the slower arcs of One Piece more on a
          re-read than during their original release. However, I keep forgetting
          this lesson. And Undead Unluck really put me in my place. I didn’t
          anticipate the kind of density that an analytic retrospective would
          reveal. There are many things I’d like to talk to you about.
          Specifically, the brilliance of the Four Seasons Saga. However, for
          the purposes of this review I’ll have to limit myself to the promising
          running start that is volume 1. I’m sure this book holds many secrets
          yet to be uncovered, many seeds that are yet to germinate. So far, in
          its currently released 117 chapters, Tozuka has patiently revealed how
          shockingly significant a lot of the seemingly minor details presented
          in the first 7 chapters of his work truly are.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Chapter one begins with an attempted suicide. I am not going to make
          assumptions about how Japanese audiences reacted to this scene. And
          I'm certainly not going to wash my dirty laundry in public. Not here,
          on this first review. Not yet. But I will confess, I did find this
          particular scene somewhat relatable. The somewhat frivolous handling
          of the normally impactful subject matter can be forgiven, or at least
          overlooked, because of its fantastical context. It's a rather common
          scenario to see characters in fiction contemplate death as an escape
          from their more supernatural conundrums. The child of a dark lord, the
          unwilling chosen one, the walking time bomb. Our protagonist, Fuuko
          Izumo, is an example of this last category. Ever since she was a
          child, everyone she touched was cursed with dangerous, even fatal
          misfortune. So, having read the newly released final chapter of her
          favorite manga, ‘To You, From Me’, she sees no more reason to prolong
          her unfortunate existence. Boy, that one hits kinda close to home.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as Fuuko is frantically explaining the situation to her
          would-be-saviors, she is restrained by a hunk of a man. Visually more
          of a Kenshiro or maybe a Goku than a Luffy or a Deku. He is big,
          imposing, and in a lot of panels even monstrous. This man beats her to
          the punch. He walks into a knife she’s holding, stabbing himself
          without much of a reaction. He’s roughly handling Fuuko, clearly
          interested in the veracity of her threats. From the instant he lands
          on the page, he’s loud, confident, impulsive, and carefree. He’s an
          instantaneous foil to the Fuuko we’ve seen so far. We soon learn these
          two have at least something in common. This man wants to die too.
          Thus, by the second page of the story, Fuuko has met her perfect
          complement.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          After this brief introduction we see Fuuko’s powers in action. Once he
          lets go of her, the man is summarily torn to pieces by the very train
          she had been waiting to jump in front of. She’s immediately concerned,
          reinforcing the already clear guilt and responsibility she feels for
          her condition. “Zombie!” She exclaims as her self-flagellation is
          interrupted by the severed head of her recent victim. “Undead!” he
          corrects her. Earlier we heard Fuuko name her curse Unluck. In this
          early echoing of the series title we’re introduced to the nomenclature
          of the story’s power system. And just as she is able to negate others’
          luck, we’re shown in amusing spectacle how Undead is able to negate
          his own death. Cheeky scenes of cartoonish mutilation serve as one of
          the principal signatures of the series. From this early on we see
          Tozuka play with Undead’s anatomy, producing dynamic panels depicting
          the non-zombie in varying stages of regeneration. There is joy in his
          movements, a distinct kinetic energy that clearly communicates the
          violence and speed with which his body replaces missing parts and
          mends injuries. We see him regrow his entire body from the stump of
          his decapitated noggin. Undead is reckless in life and battle because
          there is no such thing as danger to him.

          As he’s probing Fuuko from information on her Unluck, Undead continues
          to be brash and impudent, bordering on unpleasant. After a bout of
          fondling and threatening, the consequences of his next stroke of
          Unluck send Fuuko flying from the roof of a high-rise. In her descent
          she begins to regret her deathwish. She has a pure heart and simple
          desires. Her remorse is missing out on fashion and romance, missing
          out on normalcy. A dashing scene of heroism is colored irreverent by
          Undead’s nakedness and the ludicrously massive censor bar between his
          legs. This contrasts amusingly with the dreamy framing as Undead’s
          tenderly embraces of Fuuko, assuring that he won’t let her come to
          harm. After all, he’s finally found her. This romantic phrasing is
          interrupted by a declaration of self-interest. He’s been looking for
          someone who could possibly make him die.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          This scene draws the attention of a mysterious group of antagonists.
          The potential conflict takes a backseat to the progression of Fuuko
          and her pushy companion’s relationship. Aware that she’s unfamiliar
          with the exact boundaries of her Unluck, Fuuko and Undead begin to
          learn about each other as he tests and questions her. Tragically,
          Fuuko recalls that the worst strokes Unluck comes for the people she
          cares for the most. Her parents died after hugging her, but when her
          grandfather and Undead did the same their misfortune was negligible.
          The pain of having lost her family is however an old wound. Fuuko’s
          suffering is mostly exacerbated by her inability to connect with
          anyone else, out of a fear of hurting them. When her hat comes off
          she’s embarrassed by the state of her hair, long, damaged and unkempt.
          Her condition means she’s been unable to receive any kind of
          assistance for the past 10 years. In her short life Fuuko has missed
          out on everything. In his impossibly long life, Undead has missed out
          on nothing. He reveals that at some point he’s even dabbled in hair
          styling. We’re treated to a compassionate scene in which he carefully
          and meticulously cuts and shapes down Fuuko’s hair to a healthy
          condition. Even knowing the dangers, he’s not hesitant to touch her.
          We’ve learned now that just as he can be brazen, he can be gentle and
          comforting. He’s still forward and assertive, but he makes a tactful
          effort to bring her solace in the mundane yet painfully yearned for
          act of a haircut.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Their bonding is interrupted by the delivery of the earlier setup. The
          mysterious group tracking them makes itself known by beheading Undead
          once more. They are clearly prepared to confront him, holding
          equipment specifically designed to restrain him. They introduce to us
          more key concepts. Undead and Unluck are specifically types of
          Negators, and this group views them as threats. They lump them
          together with Unidentified Mysterious Animals, hinting that there is
          more magic to this world than what we’ve seen so far. Fuuko tries to
          make a case for Undead, now at least somewhat endeared to him. Their
          assailants are unconcerned with her protests and a battle begins.
          Undead reveals a limiter he can remove to access an eternal lifetime’s
          worth of memories. The awakened Undead easily exploits the dynamics of
          his regeneration to swiftly neutralize (read: kill) numerous goons.
          The climax of the combat scene shows us Fuuko is capable of
          weaponizing her Unluck, as she kisses Undead, confident he will
          survive but that the impact of the misfortune will be enough to
          dispose of their enemies.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          This explosive first chapter closes with a budding friendship between
          the two. Fuuko is glad to finally have someone in her life she can
          “safely” touch. She even gives him a nickname, Andy, derived
          phonetically from Undead as he doesn’t remember his actual name.
          Excited by the idea that a kiss could lead to so much damage he chases
          Fuuko trying to convince her they should shag and see what happens.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          While conceptualizing this review, I wanted to find some shoujo
          romance manga to compare the portrayal of Andy and Fuuko’s
          relationship to a more traditional love story. A lot of the romance
          manga I’ve read are very passive, the main couple falls in love
          through proximity rather than any overt flirtation. Andy’s approach is
          far more assertive, and so I asked my friends for suggestions. I
          wanted manga where one of the parties was clearly interested in wooing
          the other from the start. A friend suggested Kimi ni Todoke. ‘From Me,
          To You.’ It was then that it clicked. Fuuko’s favorite manga is a
          not-subtle-at-all nod to the famed romance series. It became
          immediately clear that Kimi ni Todoke was actually required reading in
          order to understand what Tozuka-sensei was trying to accomplish with
          Undead Unluck. The parallels are clear from the start. Kazehaya
          represents hope for Sawako. Andy is hope for Fuuko, even if she
          doesn’t know it yet. Through their courtship they help the object of
          their affections open up. They invite them into a larger world. At
          their core, these are both stories about growing through love.{" "}
