              Goldenrod is the common name for various wild plants related to
              sunflowers. The formal name for this grouping is Solidago.
              Flowering goldenrod can be found in meadows, prairies, and lush
              plains. These plants are characterized by delicate yellow flowers
              growing along a club shaped head. The stem follows an ascending
              arch, drawing a rising column of golden petals.

            Melissa Tamez had never known what it meant to feel small until that
            very moment. The figure sitting on the other side of the
            interrogation table took up the entire room. Relaxed. Their posture
            was absolutely carefree. They sat slightly forward on the metal
            chair, their back forming a gentle arch against the seat&rsquo;s
            rest. Their right leg was stretched straight, and their left foot
            rested on their lap, crossed over their knee. It seemed like the
            metal cuffs around their wrists could do nothing to restrain their
            freedom. Their hands were comfortably resting on the worn denim
            covering their thighs. They didn&rsquo;t turn to look at Melissa
            when she came through the door. They were looking off into the
            distance, as if the dull, yellowing walls of the room could do
            nothing to obstruct their sight of an infinitely vast sky. Melissa
            couldn&rsquo;t shake the impression that this person before her was
            lovingly staring at the raising moon, in the light and bright dusk
            of Texas. <br />
            They finally turned to look at her when she spoke, having taken her
            seat across from them. Their shimmering blond curls gently swayed as
            they faced her, lifted up by a breeze that blew only for them.{" "}
            <br />
            &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; <br />
            Melissa barely managed to finish the question, as she almost froze
            when those rich honey eyes settled on her. <br />
            &ldquo;Goldenrod.&rdquo;
            <br />
            She knew it was true. In a way, she knew before they said it. She
            could see it clearly. They were a cascading arc of yellow petals
            dancing gently in the wind. She could see them growing out by the
            highway, majestic in between the weeds. She didn&rsquo;t feel the
            need to ask for a last name. There wasn&rsquo;t going to be one.
            This was Goldenrod, of that she was certain.
            <br />
            She spoke it confidently. <br />
            &ldquo;Then, Goldenrod, tell me why you&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;
            <br />
            She had begun to feel more comfortable. Their presence was still
            imposing, the room might as well have always belonged to them. She
            didn&rsquo;t mind. She felt strangely welcome.
            <br />
            &ldquo;Turned myself in for homicide. Just a few minutes ago.&rdquo;
            <br />
            She couldn&rsquo;t bear to see them in bondage.
            <br />
            &ldquo;Are you comfortable?&rdquo;
            <br />
            She asked, gesturing at the handcuffs.
            <br />
            &ldquo;Ah, yeah. Freddie- Sorry, Officer Husk didn&rsquo;t want to
            put them on me, but I insisted.&rdquo;
            <br />
            They declared, amiably shaking their hands in front of them. The
            chains clinkled musically.
            <br />
            Officer Husk was a beat cop. He must have been coming back to the
            precinct when Goldenrod came in for their confession. Was this
            person familiar with him? Or did he introduce himself as Freddie?
            She thought it was unprofessional. She wasn&rsquo;t going to
            reprimand him. She was jealous. <br />
            &ldquo;You can call me Melissa.&rdquo;
            <br />
            She surprised herself with the offer. She elaborated that her proper
            title was Detective Tamez but that Melissa would indeed be fine.{" "}
            <br />
            &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pleasure.&rdquo;
            <br />
            Melissa did not know those words could be said sincerely. Most
            platitudes were simply scripted. Expected. Not this one. Goldenrod
            was truly glad to meet her.
            <br />
            She caught herself before she could reciprocate. She looked down at
            her clipboard, a hastily handwritten report of the events she had
            barely missed elucidated a surreal scene.
            <br />
            &ldquo;July twenty-seventh, nineteen-seventy-eight. Eighteen hours
            and fourteen minutes. Suspect of unknown sex, five-foot-eight,
            white, blond hair, entered the precinct carrying the corpse of a
            deceased male. Assumed victim is approximately six-foot-two,
            hispanic, black hair. Suspect offered a confession and produced a
            potential murder weapon, a seven-inch survival knife, bloodied.
            Deceased male was taken to the coroner&rsquo;s office. Initial
            examination showed deep wound in chest. Suspect shows no signs of
            injury.&rdquo;
            <br />
            Goldenrod nodded along as she read.
            <br />
            She saw it vividly in her imagination. Goldenrod gently carrying the
            larger man in both arms, like a princess. Gracefully pushing the
            glass doors open with their foot. No one dared interrupt as they
            confidently made their way inside, each step decisive yet careful,
            Goldenrod would not allow the man they carried so much as brush
            against the doorframe, a wall, or furniture. This was a ritual. The
            yellow flower made their way to the center of the lobby and slowly
            came down on one knee. Tenderly, they laid down the body on the
            floor. In a fluid motion they simultaneously stepped back and came
            down on their knees, hands behind their back. Time began to move
            once more. An officer began to take notes. Another one, Husk, made
            sure Goldenrod knew their rights. Two of them carried the corpse
            away, mindfully treating it as reverently as the suspect had.
            <br />
            &ldquo;We think we managed to identify him.&rdquo;
            <br />
            She said.
            <br />
            &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s Potro.&rdquo;
            <br />
            That was all the flower offered. That was all the detective needed.
            <br />
            Everyone knew him as Potro. Obviously, not everyone could spot him
            in a crowd, but there was no way, in a town this small, that you
            hadn&rsquo;t heard about the most eligible bachelor. Mauricio
            Monvelez was heir to the largest ranch in the region. Cuatro
            Caballos was a massive, family owned operation that moved
            significant numbers of cattle and produce. While celebrated, the
            Monvelez were reclusive. However, a death in such an economically
            powerful family would certainly shake up the town. They had to
            handle this carefully. His parents deserved to know before the
            papers did. <br />
            &ldquo;The boss knows, he saw me leaving the ranch. I&rsquo;m sure
            he will inform Mrs. Monvelez.&rdquo;
            <br />
            It was as if Goldenrod had read her mind. She shook off the thought.
            It wasn&rsquo;t that strange, she probably had her concern written
            all across her face. Instead she asked what Goldenrod meant by boss.
            <br />
            &ldquo;I am a ranch hand. Raised into it.&rdquo;
            <br />
            &ldquo;You assume the job is still yours?&rdquo;
            <br />
            &ldquo;I will always be a ranch hand.&rdquo;
            <br />
            Melissa couldn&rsquo;t hold eye contact for long. She looked down at
            the clipboard once again.
            <br />
            &ldquo;Preliminary results only show Mr. Monvelez&rsquo;s prints on
            the knife. Of course that&rsquo;s&#8230;&rdquo;
            <br />
            &ldquo;Expected, given the situation. Right?&rdquo;
            <br />
            Goldenrod showed her their fingers. She had noticed it before. Even
            from across the table it was plain to see. Her team had told her
            before she came in, they had been unable to take any prints. The
            tips of the suspect's digits were perfectly smooth. There was no
            sign of scarring. If they had been burned off it had been a
            miraculous job, or done long, long ago. <br />
            Goldenrod continued to speak.
            <br />
            &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to hold a weapon to hurt someone.&rdquo;
