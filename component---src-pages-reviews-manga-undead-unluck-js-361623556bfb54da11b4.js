I am not going to make assumptions about how Japanese audiences reacted to this scene. And I'm certainly not going to wash my dirty laundry in public. Not here, on this first review. Not yet. But I will confess, this scene did remind me of how tempting a solution the immediate cessation of my bodily processes sounded to teenage me. The somewhat frivolous handling of the normally impactful subject matter can be forgiven, or at least overlooked, because of its fantastical context. And is this not always the case? It's a rather common scenario to see characters in fiction contemplate death as an escape from their more supernatural conundrums. The child of a dark lord, the unwilling chosen one, the walking time bomb. Our protagonist, Fuuko, is an example of this last category. Ever since she was a child, everyone she touched was cursed with dangerous, even fatal misfortune. So, having read the newly released final chapter of her favorite manga, she sees no more reason to prolong her unfortunate existence. Boy, isn't that one relatable?"),n.createElement(o.Z,{variant:"body1",paragraph:!0},"Fate plays its hand essentially immediately with this one. Fuuko's attempt is interrupted by our second protagonist. That's right. We've got 2 central characters at the forefront of this tale. And it makes sense to reveal now that you're looking at a romance series. Yes, it's a paranormal mystery battle manga, but it's also a love story. Not in the sense that other battle manga have tangential love stories, like the admittedly shallow domesticity of Goku and Chichi, or the committed but quiet engagement of Yoh and Anna Asakura, or the footnote that is the marriage between Naruto and Hinata. These two's relationship is front and center, beginning with this intriguing first encounter."," "),n.createElement(o.Z,{variant:"body1",paragraph:!0},"Just as Fuuko is warning those who might attempt to save her by claiming that touching her means death, she is restrained by a hunk of a man. This guy is clearly more of a Kenshiro or maybe a Goku than a Luffy or a Deku. He is big, imposing, and in a lot of panels even monstrous. We'll get back to that in a minute. For now let's go back to first impressions. This man beats her to the punch. He walks into a knife she’s holding, stabbing himself without much of a reaction. He’s roughly handling Fuuko, clearly interested in the veracity of her threats. From the instant he lands on the page, he’s loud, confident, impulsive, and carefree. We’ll learn eventually that this is almost all opposite of Fuuko. For now, we know they have something in common. This man wants to die too. By the second page of the story, Fuuko has met her perfect complement."," "),n.createElement(o.Z,{variant:"body1",paragraph:!0},"After this brief introduction we see Fuuko’s powers in action. Once he lets go of her, the man is summarily torn to pieces by the very train Fuuko had been waiting to jump infront of. She’s immediately concerned, reinforcing the already clear guilt and responsibility she feels for her condition. “Zombie!” She exclaims as her self-flagellation is interrupted by the severed head of her recent victim. “Undead!” he corrects her. Earlier we heard Fuuko name her curse Unluck. In this early echoing of the series title we’re introduced to the nomenclature of the story’s power system. And just as she is able to negate others’ luck, we’re shown in amusing spectacle how Undead is able to negate his own death. Cheeky scenes of cartoonish mutilation serve as one of the principal flavors of the series. From this early on we see Tozuka play with Undead’s anatomy with dynamic panels depicting the non-zombie in varying stages of regeneration. There is joy in his movements, a distinct kinetic energy that clearly communicates the violence and speed with which his body replaces missing parts and mends injuries. We see him regrow his entire body from the stump of his decapitated noggin. Undead is reckless in life and battle because there is no such thing as danger to him."),n.createElement(o.Z,{variant:"body1",paragraph:!0}," ","As he’s probing Fuuko from information on her Unluck, Undead continues to be brash and impudent, bordering on unpleasant. After a bout of fondling and threatening the consequences of his next stroke of Unluck send Fuuko flying from the roof of a high-rise. In her descent she begins to regret her deathwish after all. She has a pure heart and simple desires. Her remorse is missing out on fashion and romance, missing out on normalcy. A dashing scene of heroism is colored irreverent by Undead’s nakedness and the ludicrously massive censor bar between his legs. This contrasts amusingly with the dreamy framing of Undead’s tender embrace of Fuuko, with his reassurance that he won’t let her come to harm. After all, he’s finally found her. This romantic phrasing is interrupted by a declaration of self-interest. He’s been looking for someone who could possibly make him die."," "),n.createElement(o.Z,{variant:"body1",paragraph:!0},"This scene draws the attention of a mysterious group of antagonists. The potential conflict takes a backseat to the progression of Fuuko and her pushy companion’s relationship. Clearly aware that she’s unfamiliar with the exact boundaries of her Unluck, Fuuko and Undead begin to learn about each other as he tests and questions her. Tragically, Fuuko recalls that the worst strokes Unluck comes for the people she cares for the most. Her parents died after hugging her, but when her grandfather and Undead did the same their misfortune was negligible. The pain of having lost her family is however an old wound, Fuuko’s suffering is mostly exacerbated by her innability to connect with anyone else, out of a fear of hurting them. When her hat comes off she’s embarrassed by the state of her hair, long, damaged and unkempt. Her condition means she’s been unable to receive any kind of assistance for the past 10 years. In her short life Fuuko has missed out on everything. In his impossibly long life, Undead has missed out on nothing. He reveals that at some point he’s even dabbled in hair styling. We’re treated to a compassionate scene in which he carefully and meticulously cuts and shapes down Fuuko’s hair to a healthy condition. We’ve learned now that just as he can be brazen, he can be gentle and comforting. He’s still forward and assertive, but he makes a tactful effort to bring her solace in the mundane yet painfully yearned for act of a haircut."),n.createElement(o.Z,{variant:"body1",paragraph:!0}," ","Their bonding is interrupted by the delivery of the earlier setup. The mysterious group tracking them makes itself known by beheading Undead once more. They are clearly prepared to confront him, holding equipment specifically designed to restrain him. They intoduce to us more key concepts. Undead and Unluck are specifically types of Negators, and this group views them as threats. They lump them together with Unidentified Mysterious Animals, hinting that there is more magic to this world than what we’ve seen so far. Fuuko tries to make a case for Undead, now at least somewhat endeared to him. Their assailants are unconcerned with her protests and a battle begins that serves to lay down more hooks to catch our interest. Where do these guys get their equipment? They have an unbreakable sword, probably the work of another negator. How far can Undead push his power? He reveals he has a limiter he can remove to access and eternal lifetime’s worth of memories. The awakened Undead easily exploits the dynamics of his regeneration to swiftly neutralize (read: kill) numerous goons. Can Fuuko learn to use her Unluck effectively in battle? The climax of the combat scene implies yes, as Fuuko kisses Undead, confident he will survive but that the impact of the misfortune will be enough to dispose of their enemies."),n.createElement(o.Z,{variant:"body1",paragraph:!0}," ","This explosive first chapter closes with a budding friendship between the two. Fuuko is glad to finally have someone in her life she can “safely” touch. She even gives him a nickname, Andy, derived phonetically from Undead as he doesn’t remember his actual name. Excited by the idea that a kiss lead to so much damage he chases Fuuko trying to convince her they should shag and see what happens. The narration gives us a compelling promise, this will be the story of the greatest death ever."))}}},5213:function(e,t,a){a.r(t),a.d(t,{default:function(){return h}});var n=a(7294),s=a(3112),o=a(262),i=a(3322),r=function(e){return n.createElement(s.Z,null,n.createElement(o.Z,{title:"w2l: "+e.book}),n.createElement(i.Z,e),n.createElement("br",null),n.createElement("br",null),e.body)},c=a(5769).A["undead-unluck"],h=function(){return n.createElement(r,c)}},3290:function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/937bd2673112ef97917d7953d4985475/a8ed9/undead-unluck.png","srcSet":"/static/937bd2673112ef97917d7953d4985475/57ffd/undead-unluck.png 100w,\\n/static/937bd2673112ef97917d7953d4985475/7c0b5/undead-unluck.png 200w,\\n/static/937bd2673112ef97917d7953d4985475/a8ed9/undead-unluck.png 400w,\\n/static/937bd2673112ef97917d7953d4985475/9c69e/undead-unluck.png 800w","sizes":"(min-width: 400px) 400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/937bd2673112ef97917d7953d4985475/f2cb4/undead-unluck.webp 100w,\\n/static/937bd2673112ef97917d7953d4985475/f9911/undead-unluck.webp 200w,\\n/static/937bd2673112ef97917d7953d4985475/3d164/undead-unluck.webp 400w,\\n/static/937bd2673112ef97917d7953d4985475/3d761/undead-unluck.webp 800w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 400px) 400px, 100vw"}]},"width":400,"height":600}')},2407:function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/9baefdeb32708872e8acdf3c7aa57595/ca121/ss-icon.png","srcSet":"/static/9baefdeb32708872e8acdf3c7aa57595/549c4/ss-icon.png 5w,\\n/static/9baefdeb32708872e8acdf3c7aa57595/ebf64/ss-icon.png 10w,\\n/static/9baefdeb32708872e8acdf3c7aa57595/ca121/ss-icon.png 20w,\\n/static/9baefdeb32708872e8acdf3c7aa57595/f31ef/ss-icon.png 40w","sizes":"(min-width: 20px) 20px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/9baefdeb32708872e8acdf3c7aa57595/fadb2/ss-icon.webp 5w,\\n/static/9baefdeb32708872e8acdf3c7aa57595/bd5c1/ss-icon.webp 10w,\\n/static/9baefdeb32708872e8acdf3c7aa57595/264f2/ss-icon.webp 20w,\\n/static/9baefdeb32708872e8acdf3c7aa57595/e73fe/ss-icon.webp 40w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 20px) 20px, 100vw"}]},"width":20,"height":20}')},7692:function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/48232aa40e7614282b03bc6641640a4b/e9fba/w2l-icon.png","srcSet":"/static/48232aa40e7614282b03bc6641640a4b/86ee2/w2l-icon.png 13w,\\n/static/48232aa40e7614282b03bc6641640a4b/88208/w2l-icon.png 25w,\\n/static/48232aa40e7614282b03bc6641640a4b/e9fba/w2l-icon.png 50w,\\n/static/48232aa40e7614282b03bc6641640a4b/15e42/w2l-icon.png 100w","sizes":"(min-width: 50px) 50px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/48232aa40e7614282b03bc6641640a4b/68795/w2l-icon.webp 13w,\\n/static/48232aa40e7614282b03bc6641640a4b/2fa99/w2l-icon.webp 25w,\\n/static/48232aa40e7614282b03bc6641640a4b/dbc4a/w2l-icon.webp 50w,\\n/static/48232aa40e7614282b03bc6641640a4b/d8057/w2l-icon.webp 100w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 50px) 50px, 100vw"}]},"width":50,"height":50}')}}]);
