They were looking off into the distance, as if the dull, yellowing walls of the room could do nothing to obstruct their sight of an infinitely vast sky.

This was a ritual. The yellow flower made their way to the center of the lobby and slowly came down on one knee. Tenderly, they laid down the body on the floor.
